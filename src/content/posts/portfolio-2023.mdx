blurb: "Portfolio Website Overhaul"
category: "projects"
datePublished: "2023-04-22"
description: "As a means to learn the Astro web framework and cut out the monthly cost of a server for my portfolio website, this portfolio website overhaul ditches the vanilla PHP, MySQL, and NGINX hosted on DigitalOcean from my 2022 portfolio website in favor of Astro hosted on Netlify. This third version of my portfolio website is also inspired by the Google Material Design system introduced with Android 12 in 2021, which is minimal and allows for dynamic color theming."
