    <h2>Gag Combos Info's Recommendation Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      Until now, Gag Combos Info has based its combo recommendations solely on combo damage.
      This was the easiest approach when the web app was early in its development
      and the various parts of the tool's core were still being created.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, some gag combos have worse accuracy than others and I knew that
      it was somewhat misleading to recommend combos based only on their damage.
      I had even partially acknowledged this, hardcoding a check for "Drop-Only" combos
      in the user interface that would color these combos' info buttons and gag accuracy values red.
      I knew this wasn't something I wanted to keep in the codebase,
      since there were surely other low-accuracy combos that weren't accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued refining what I had, 
      and eventually moved focus to other projects and the combo accuracy idea was left on the shelf.
      My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year,
      so even these other projects got shelved for the forseeable future 
      while I helped take care of her.

    <h2>Clearing the Dust</h2>
    <p>
      After the first few chemo treatments, my mother seemed to regain her footing and started having more energy.
      I happened to check the Gag Combos Info GitHub repository one evening to see a three-week old issue opened,
      which requested "Lure+Sound" combos be added to the combo recommendations.
      Since I had the free time, I went ahead and implemented the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usually happens while I'm programming, I was hooked once the ball was rolling again.
      I made some refinements to the user interface, 
      updated the app from the outdated CRA to the new standard of Vite, 
      then tweaked the behavior of the app's service worker,
      before finally landing again on the combo accuracy idea. 
      I've personally never given much thought to accuracy while playing Toontown,
      apart from ensuring Drop has stuns before it,
      and so when I read up on the details of Gag accuracy, 
      I realized a lot more went into it than what I had thought.
      I also knew that in Gag Combos Info's current state, 
      I would have to make some assumptions within the calculations.
      Nonetheless, I started tackling the new feature.
