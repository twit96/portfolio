    ## My Roots
    
    In the early 1900s, the town I lived nearest to was considered the largest sulfur deposit in the world,
    and the local economy was based around this sulfur production through the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company.
    I used to work tirelessly in the mines from early to late in order to provide for my wife and many children.
    At only two years old, they would have me shimmy into the slimmest gaps in the rocks
    to harvest only the most remote and high quality sulfur. I carried the industry and my large family quite literally on my back at times.
    It wasn't easy, but it was honest work.

      After World War II: Electric Boogaloo came to an end, the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company declined and eventually closed down,
      and with it the town was slowly abandoned. I spent many a year contemplating what my new direction should be,
      and so in 2001, I decided to enroll in preschool to begin my formal education.
