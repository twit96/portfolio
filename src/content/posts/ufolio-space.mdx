    ## Development Notes
    
    Ufolio.Space is built with a PHP framework called 
    <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>.
    Laravel is flexible in that it allows you to either create a "monolith" application 
    (in which the frontend and backend are all part of the same code base),
    or to create a REST API as a standalone backend codebase,
    which you can plug a separate frontend codebase into.
    Currently, Ufolio.Space is a monolith. 
    Since it was my first project created with Laravel,
    I wanted to focus in on the Laravel framework with no distractions as I programmed.
    However, now that I am comfortable with Laravel, 
    I think it would be beneficial to split the backend from the frontend for Ufolio.Space to scale.

    ## Planned Refactoring
    
    After doing a bit of research, I want to split Ufolio.Space into a Laravel REST API with a 
    <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> frontend.
    Flutter is promising because it allows you to create a single frontend codebase,
    which can be deployed to the web, iOS, Android, MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
    If successful, splitting Ufolio.Space into a Laravel backend with a Flutter frontend 
    would create a versatile, cross-platform application.

      ### Flutter Tangent (Tl;dr: My phone can be laggy)
      
      I have noticed that the couple of Flutter applications that I have tested on my Pixel 6 Pro phone 
      have some minor lag, notably on scrolling through content sections.
      However, I also know that the Pixel 6 lineup with the Tensor G1 chipset had inherent issues at launch, 
      even to the point that Google Chrome would cause noticeable GPU lag spikes on my personal phone 
      whenever I hit the top of webpages that utilized JavaScript scroll event listeners 
      (a major debugging nightmare for me on a couple of my past projects).
    
    
      I even programmed around this (now fixed) Android Google Chrome bug on
      <a href="https://gagcombos.info/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gag Combos Info</a>,
      in which you may notice that the &lt;body&gt; tag does not scroll, 
      but instead there is a page-wide wrapper which scrolls, 
      preventing Android's "elastic overscroll" effect from triggering.
      The Google Chrome issue has since been fixed on my Pixel 6 Pro, 
      and therefore I feel at worst hopeful, if not entirely confident 
      that the minor lag I experienced with the Flutter apps I tried to be isolated to my specific chipset,
      with a promising future outlook. At best, Flutter is going to make Ufolio.Space my best project to date.

    ## Moving Forward
    
    All this considered, Ufolio.Space is currently in a bit of limbo.
    I usually like to dedicate a single project to learning each new web framework.
    Therefore, ideally I will create a standalone Flutter project 
    before I dive into this major refactor of Ufolio.Space. 
  
  
    Nonetheless, feel free to check out 
    <a href="https://ufolio.space/">Ufolio.Space</a>
    as it currently stands, and feel free to contact me with any feedback!
